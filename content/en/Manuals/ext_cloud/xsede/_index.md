If you require large amounts of resources (ie. 1000s of CPUs, or 100s of GPUs) then access to the computing resources at the [NSF](https://nsf.gov/) funded [XSEDE](https://www.xsede.org/) might be a good option.

## Account

To create an account, visit the [XSEDE Portal](https://portal.xsede.org/documentation-overview#portal).

## Proposal

As stated previously, writting a propoasl and then getting it approved is required to gain access to XSEDE. Instructions on how to do this are outlined [here](https://portal.xsede.org/documentation-overview#allocations-webinar).

## Data Management

There are several methods used to transfer data to and from XSEDE resources, they are outlined [here](https://portal.xsede.org/documentation-overview#transferring)

## Jobs

For submitting jobs, XSEDE also supports Slurm, which is similar to what we already use on the HPC cluster.

Example on how to submit Slurm style jobs are described [here](https://portal.xsede.org/documentation-overview#compenv-jobs)

## UCR Campus Champion

You can contact [Jordan Hayes](mailto:jordan.hayes@ucr.edu) for additional information regarding XSEDE and how to gain access.
